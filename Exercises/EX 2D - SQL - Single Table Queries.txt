--Exercise 5
--select empid, lastname
--from hr.Employees
--where lastname collate Latin1_General_CS_AS like N'[abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]%';

--Exercise 6
--select empid, count(*) AS numorders
--from sales.orders
--where orderdate < '20160501'
--group by empid

--select empid, count(*) AS numorders
--from sales.orders
--group by empid
--having max(orderdate) < '20160501'

--The difference between these two searches is the use of the WHERE and HAVING filters. In the first search WHERE filters by rows, so what we are seeing
--in the output is the total number of orders each employee handled before 20160501. The HAVING statement filters by group, so what we are seeing in the
--output are the employees that haven't processed any orders since 20160501.
